# The Phone store project

This website was created using React, Typescript, SCSS. You can view it at the following [demo link](https://fe-feb23-department-6.github.io/phone_store/)

The data for the site is dynamically retrieved from a remote server created using Node.js, Express, Typescript, Sequelize and hosted at [this link](https://backend-phone-store.onrender.com/). 
 
The PostgreSQL database for this project is also remotely hosted, which further enhances the robustness and scalability of the application 

If you're interested in seeing Ð° design that was used to create the project, you can find it [here](https://www.figma.com/file/FRxncC4lfyhs6og1L6FGEU/Phone-catalog-(V2)-Rounded-Style-2?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=MOhr6TsL9FgGv1I0-0)
